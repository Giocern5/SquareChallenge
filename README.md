## Steps to run the app
Clone repository. Open project with A.S. and click the run app button at the top

## What areas of the app did you focus on?
I focused mostly on user experience by making the UI user friendly. By this I mean easy readability and following current social media structures so
it gives the user some familiarity when using this app

## What was the reason for your focus? What problems were you trying to solve?
To improve user experience. I was trying to solve the problem of keeping user retention by creating a view that is simple and easy to follow

## How long did you spend on this project?
Almost 5 hours

## Did you make any trade-offs for this project? What would you have done differently with more time?
Yes I spent most of my time working on the UI and due to this I had less time for unit tests. I would have added more features such as a sort
button given certain factors such as "same team", "Same employee type", ect..

## What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
I would definitely saying unit testing is the weakest. I added some examples of a unit test to files but was not able to get unit tests to work on 
my project for some reason. Due to time contraints, I wasnt able to further investigate.

Dependencies were found online. Some code snippets were from a previous side project I did

## Is there any other information youâ€™d like us to know?
The main focus of the UI was for phones
